🧠 What is a Closure? (Simple Interview Answer)

A closure is when a function remembers the variables from the place where it was created, even after that place has finished executing.

In simple words:
🚀 A function carries its outer variables with it, no matter where it is called later.

🔥 Example (Clear + Simple)
function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return inner;
}

const fn = outer();
fn(); // 10


What happened:

1️⃣ outer() ran
2️⃣ It created variable a = 10
3️⃣ It returned inner function

Even though outer() finished execution:
✔ inner() still “remembers” the value of a
✔ Because of closure

This is the essence of closure.

🤔 Why does this happen?

Because JavaScript keeps the lexical environment of the function when it is created.

So:

inner function keeps a reference to 'a'


Even after outer is done.

That’s the magic of closure.

🧠 Interview Definition (Short)

A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables even after the parent function has returned.

📌 When is Closure Created?

Closures are created whenever:

✔ A function is returned from another function
✔ A function is passed to another function
✔ A function is used after its outer function finishes

🔥 More Examples
📍 Example 1 — Counter
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
}

const increase = counter();

increase(); // 1
increase(); // 2
increase(); // 3


Why this works:

counter() returns the inner function

inner function remembers count

every call updates the same count

This behavior is only possible because of closures.

📍 Example 2 — Private Variables
function secret(name) {
  return function () {
    console.log("My name is " + name);
  };
}

const showName = secret("Darsh Reddy");
showName(); // My name is Darsh Reddy


Use case:

Keep sensitive data hidden

Only exposed via returned function

🧠 When are Closures Useful? (Interview points)
✅ 1) Data Privacy / Encapsulation

Used to hide variables from outside:

const person = (function () {
  let age = 30;
  return {
    getAge: function () {
      return age;
    }
  };
})();

console.log(person.getAge()); // 30

✅ 2) Maintaining State

Used in counters, timers, accumulators:

const inc = counter();
inc(); // 1
inc(); // 2

✅ 3) Callback Functions

Closures help callbacks remember context.

Example:

function sayLater(msg) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(msg);
  }, 1000);
}

sayLater("Hi"); // prints "Hi" after 1s

✅ 4) Functional Programming

Used in:
✔ map
✔ filter
✔ reduce
✔ partial application
✔ currying

🧠 How to Explain to Interviewer (One Line)

A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside of it.
It helps in data privacy, state maintenance, and creating functions with memory.

🧠 Common Closure Questions (Interview Quick-Shots)
Q: Does every function create closure?

Answer: Yes — but only important when inner function accesses outer variables.

Q: Are closures memory heavy?

Answer: No — JS engines optimize memory. Only variables that are used are kept alive.

Q: Difference between closure and scope?

Answer:

Scope → where variables are visible

Closure → function remembers scope even after parent execution is done

🧠 Final Simple Summary
Closure = Function + Access to its Outer Variables


Example:

function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a); // remembers even after outer is done
  }
  return inner;
}
