1)JS is a single threaded language and it can do only one thing at a time and it have only one call stack

2)what ever code we give for js it will be quickly executed by js engine it doesnot wait for anything

3)in this example ::

console.log("hi");
console.log("adarsh");
console.log("bye");

// hi adarsh byee 

so what if we need wait at adarsh and then print byee means or else we need print this after after 5 seconds console.log("adarsh"); we just wrap it into a callback function 

console.log("hi");
setTimeout(function (){
	console.log("adarsh");
},5000);
console.log("bye");

so now to print adarsh message is job of setTimeout web API'S , so using callback is a powerful way to do asynchronous thing in js and we can take a code and pass it to seTimeout and will execute later that's done 

callback plays a very important role in writing asynchronous code in js so this was a fresher example lets take one more senior level example
