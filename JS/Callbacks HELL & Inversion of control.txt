1)JS is a single threaded language and it can do only one thing at a time and it have only one call stack

2)what ever code we give for js it will be quickly executed by js engine it doesnot wait for anything

3)in this example ::

console.log("hi");
console.log("adarsh");
console.log("bye");

// hi adarsh byee 

so what if we need wait at adarsh and then print byee means or else we need print this after after 5 seconds console.log("adarsh"); we just wrap it into a callback function 

console.log("hi");
setTimeout(function (){
	console.log("adarsh");
},5000);
console.log("bye");

so now to print adarsh message is job of setTimeout web API'S , so using callback is a powerful way to do asynchronous thing in js and we can take a code and pass it to seTimeout and will execute later that's done 

callback plays a very important role in writing asynchronous code in js so this was a fresher example lets take one more senior level example 

--e commerce website so first create order then proceed to payment---
const cart = ["shoes","pants","tshirts"];

//we have api's to create order and payment api's
 
api.createorder()
api.payment()

so we need to create order first then we should procced to payment there is dependency so now callback comes into picture so we will wrap proceed to payment api inside function createorder

api.createorder(cart,functin(){
	api.payment()
})

so we passes cart items and payment function as argument to createorder function 
so how code will be executed so when js executes it just executes createoerder api so we passed payment callback function to createorder api now it is responsibility of createorder api to execute payment function 

so now after payment success we need to show order summary page so we create order summary function and pass it as callback to the paymane function 

const cart = ["shoes","pants","tshirts"];
api.createorder(cart,functin(){
	api.payment(paymentstatus,function () {
		api.ordersummary();
	})
})

so now ordersummary is handled by payment function one after another 


so now HELL comes to picture as schoolbus came early in morning as normal time 

so we need to update wallet for that we gain have api like 

const cart = ["shoes","pants","tshirts"];
api.createorder(cart,functin(){
	api.payment(paymentstatus,function () {
		api.ordersummary(function (){
			api.updatewallet();
		});
	})
})


so many API'S dependent on one of other 
so what is callback hell onecallback nother callback and some if statements some randon calls it gone to well like sahasam movie only not coming out easily codes goes growing horizontally not vertically so simply callback hell is sahasam movie

and unmaintanable maintainability is tough and I seen that callback hell code lot of projects 

so the structure is also knows as pyramid of doom you can google it 

and now Inversion of control comes in to the picture ::: 

so now here 

api.createorder(cart,function() {
	api.proceedtoPayment()
})

so now we blindly trusting creteorder api that in some point of time it will create the order and call our proceedtopayment callback function api so it is very risky right we gave control of payment to the createorder api to cann our function back and we blindly trusting that what if our callback function never called right it might happen in some cases and what if proceedtopayment function called twice 


next we are going to cover promises promises promise 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
