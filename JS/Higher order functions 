Higher order Function ::::

- A function which takes another function as a argument or returns a function is known as higher order function 

example :: 
function x() {
	console.log("namaste");
}
function y(x){
	x();
}

-so here y is a higher order function it takes x as a argument and what is x then x becomes the call back function synchronous callback function because it is dependent on y function to call its invocation until we wont call it wont execute 

so now want to write program for the calculatearea and calculatecircumference and calculatediameter how we actually write 

example::: 
*****const radius = [1,2,3,4];

const calculatearea = function (radius){
	const output = [];
	for (let i=0;i<radius.length;i++){
	output.push(Math.PI*radius[i]*radius[i]);
	}
	return output;
};

console.log(calculatearea(radius));

const calculatecircumference = function (radius){
	const output = [];
	for (let i=0;i<radius.length;i++){
	output.push(2*Math.PI*radius[i]);
	}
	return output;
};

console.log(calculatecircumference(radius));

const calculatediameter = function (radius){
	const output = [];
	for (let i=0;i<radius.length;i++){
	output.push(2*radius[i]);
	}
	return output;
};

console.log(calculatediameter(radius)); *****

so now before learning about the problem will see what is the function expression and why we called like that 
((((( Key Differences:
Hoisting: Function declarations (normal functions) are moved to the top of their scope, allowing invocation before declaration. Function expressions are not hoisted, resulting in a ReferenceError if called prematurely.
Definition Syntax:
Normal (Declaration): function greet() { ... }.
Expression: const greet = function() { ... }; or const greet = () => { ... };.
Execution Timing: Normal functions are loaded before any code executes. Function expressions are loaded only when the interpreter reaches that line.
Usage: Normal functions are ideal for global scope functions, while expressions are better for closures, callbacks, or passing functions as arguments.

Example:
javascript
// Function Declaration (Works)
sayHello();
function sayHello() { console.log("Hello!"); }

// Function Expression (Errors)
sayHi(); // TypeError: sayHi is not a function
var sayHi = function() { console.log("Hi!"); };   )))))


-- so now in above example calculatcircumference calculatearea and calculatediameter example what is the problem so in future if something want to calculate means we will one more function its not good practice right 
-- so we should writhe reusable code not like this 

++++++  const radius = [1,2,3,4];

const area = function(radius){
	return Math.PI*radius*radius;
}

const diameter = function(radius){
	return 2*radius;
}

const circumference = function(radius){
	return 2*Math.PI*radius;
}

const calculate = function (radius,logic){
 const output = [];
 for (let i=0;i<radius.length;i++){
	output.push(logic(radius[i]));
 }
 }

const calculate(radius,area);
const calculate(radius,diameter);
const calculate(radius,circumference);

-- this is functional programming and why this is good 
--re-usability, modularity, and we say calculate is the higher order function and function area diameter and circumferenceare callback functions passed after sometime
-- this is exactly doing what map() will do 

const calculate = function (radius,logic){
 const output = [];
 for (let i=0;i<radius.length;i++){
	output.push(logic(radius[i]));
 }
 }
 
 so we can do directly like this 
 
      radius.map(area);
	  
	  so this map function maps whole array with some logic 
	  
	  console.log(radius.map(area));
	  
	  so we kind of wrote or Implementation of map 
	  
	  so nothing difference for both 
	  
	  radius.map(area); and calculatearea(radius,area);


---------------------🔹 Higher-Order Function
A higher-order function is a function that either:

Takes another function as an argument, or

Returns another function.

👉 In your code, area is not a higher-order function. It’s just a regular function that takes an array and returns a new array of computed values.
If you had used something like map, filter, or reduce, those would be higher-order functions because they accept other functions as arguments.

Example:

js
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
const area = arr.map(r => Math.PI * r * r); 
Here, map is the higher-order function because it takes a function (r => Math.PI * r * r) as input.

🔹 Passed Function vs. Called Function
Passed function: When you give a function as an argument to another function, without executing it.
Example:

js
setTimeout(myFunc, 1000); // passing myFunc
Here, myFunc is passed, not executed immediately.

Called function: When you actually invoke/execute the function with parentheses.
Example:

js
setTimeout(myFunc(), 1000); // calling myFunc immediately
This runs myFunc right away and passes its return value to setTimeout.

In your code:

js
let area = function area1(arr){
    let output = [];
    for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        output.push(Math.PI*arr[i]*arr[i]);
    }
    return output;
}
🔹 What is area1?
area1 is the name of the function (a named function expression).

You assigned that function to the variable area.

So you can call it using area(arr).

🔹 Named Function Expression vs Anonymous Function Expression
Named function expression:

js
let f = function myFunc() { ... }
Here, myFunc is the internal name of the function. It’s useful for debugging (stack traces show myFunc) and recursion (the function can call itself by name inside its body).

Anonymous function expression:

js
let f = function() { ... }
No internal name — only accessible via the variable f.

🔹 In Your Case
area1 is the internal name of the function.

area is the variable holding that function.

You call it with area(arr).

If you tried area1(arr) outside of that definition, it would throw an error because area1 only exists inside the function itself (not in the outer scope).

So:

area → the variable you use to call the function.

area1 → the function’s internal name (mainly for debugging or recursion).
